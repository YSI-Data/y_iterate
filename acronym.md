# What Does YSI Stand For?

No-one actually knows!  The original idea was "Y_Less' Server Includes", but "Script" and "Server" were frequently intermixed, and there are more devs than just Y_Less now, so the "Y" just became a recursive acronym for "YSI".  There are now several official meanings, each incorporating different aspects of YSI:

## YSI Script Includes

Core libraries.

## YSI Scripting Improvements

Coding libraries (pawn language extensions).

## YSI Server Includes

Game related stuff (commands, properties, text etc).

## YSI Script Incidentals

Extras, like login and commands.

## YSI Seriously Incomprehensible

The macros (though in their defense, writing macros to do the parsing within the compiler limitations is VERY hard).

## YSI Stupid Includes

y_tho.
